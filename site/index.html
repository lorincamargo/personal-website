                        <p>I was born and raised in San José, California and am a graduate of San Francisco State University, where I studied Apparel Design and Merchandising. Following graduation, I lived in New York, where I worked in fashion production, and as a freelance seamstress and sewing instructor. I realized an interest in community building after taking part in a Civic Hackathon which aimed to solve community issues in Brooklyn, NY. </p>
                        <p>After moving back to the Bay Area, I have worked as a Council Assistant for Council District 3, the Downtown core, of the City of San José. I have also been an active leader in volunteer-run organizations Code for San José and Catalyze SV, both of which work toward civic improvement through innovation and community engagement. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">I thought it would be a great idea to combine the need for more public art in San José with the format of a hackathon, giving the community a welcoming space to meet, form teams, and write grant proposals for their own public art projects. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">I realized shortly after coming up with the idea that one of the major grants that I wanted to highlight at the event had a deadline coming up. This meant I had a short amount of time to put the event together, so right away I got to work. I came up with a plan, found a venue to host us pro-bono, planned for food and supplies, created promotional material, reached out to speakers, to the City, and to local organizations and then to the public to get the word out. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">As someone who gets around without a car, I was excited at the opportunity to collaborate with the City of San José on their Pop-up Bikeways Project.  </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">San José is a very car-centric city, with a majority of space taken up by single-family homes, highways, shopping malls and parking lots. I grew up in San José and for me it has always felt like a disconnected place, full of obstacles for anyone who gets around without a car.   </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <img src="img/portfolio/pub-sj.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="image-alt">

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">Because I’m not alone in this thought, there are several initiatives by the City, by local organizations and by the community to create a more walkable and bikeable city.   </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">I first heard about the Pop-up Bikeways Project from our Brigade Captain at Code for San José (CfSJ). At the time, I had been working with another member of CfSJ to create time-lapse videos of public space and after our videos were shared with City staff, we heard back that there was interest in our work.    </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">We were told that in just two days’ time, the Department of Transportation would be presenting their Pop-up Bikeways Project to the community and its stakeholders, and they wanted us to make a promotional video to highlight the project.   </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">The objective of Pop-up Bikeways was to get the public excited about bringing more bike lanes to San José. It was a prototype created by the City, where staff members spent a day under the sun, spray painting the road, assembling planters and putting up signage to create a temporary bike lane that would be available for the public to use for one week’s time. </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">Knowing that community support is crucial to creating more and better bike lanes, we were excited to help spread the word about the project and quickly, with a suddenly tight deadline to meet, we got to work on the video.  </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">We used our early mornings, lunch breaks and afternoons to shoot everything we needed and then we stayed up late, editing away at a co-working space to complete the video in time for the community meetings that week.   </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">The event was described as an ‘unconference’, which was a term I hadn’t heard before, and this meant discussions would be led by participants instead of a pre-selected group of leaders. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">Excited and curious at the opportunity, I immediately signed up to attend and, shortly after, I submitted some ideas for the break-out sessions. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">I didn’t know that I would actually be leading two of the break-out sessions until minutes before they began at the conference. All of the ideas submitted were posted on a wall for everyone to view, and each attendee was given set of stickers to vote for the ideas they wanted to explore. </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">As a non-developer involved with civic tech, I thought it would be important to talk about how to better include non-developers in our brigades. I wasn’t the only one who had submitted this idea, though, so on the first day of break-out sessions and with a combined tally of votes, I was partnered up with a leader from Code for Boston and together we eagerly set off to facilitate the discussion. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">There was a large turn-out in our meeting room, and we had to keep a strict eye on the time to make sure everyone who wanted to speak had a chance to take the floor. Sitting in a circle with more than 50 brigade leaders from across the country, we talked about what has worked, what hasn’t and how we can apply lessons learned to welcome in people from all skillsets and backgrounds into our tech-heavy community. </p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">With many helpful stories and ideas shared during this first session, the meeting ended with a feeling of excitement and eagerness to experiment with new concepts and continue the conversation between brigades in the future. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">I was surprised on the second day of break-out sessions when I heard my name called to lead another discussion, this time for my idea to talk about easy-win projects. I had co-created a promotional video called Pop-up Bikeways that ended up being a great way to connect and collaborate with local government, and thought this would be a great strategy to share for building partnerships. It was an ‘easy-win’ because the project was complete within two days of starting and required no maintenance after it was finished, yet it made a big impact. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">With a smaller group than the first day’s discussion, we were able to have an intimate, relaxed meeting with a lot of laughs and unbridled brainstorming. </p>

Tech can play a role, but it isn’t a requirement, and for me, this is a very important point to emphasize — because if we want to solve problems in a creative way, we need as many perspectives and skills as possible and we can’t get that from a room exclusively filled with developers.  </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">Working as a Council Aide, I had heard a lot of concerns from the community about how frustrating it can be to use the City’s website, which is often described as text-heavy and “clunky”. </p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">This is why, for the District 3 website, one major goal was to make it easy for the public to search for and find specific policy memos. I did this by creating an interface that separated memos into different categories (e.g. Housing & Renters’ Rights, Arts & Culture, etc.) and organized everything by date. With this, finding specific policy memos will be easier for the public.</p>

For this reason, we made sure the website included contact information for upwards of 50 Neighborhood Association leaders. This will make it easier for community members to reach out to people already involved in particular neighborhoods to find out how they can become involved themselves.</p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">At the completion of the website, I created a Website Guidebook to help ensure future District 3 Council Staff are able to quickly and easily maintain the website without the help of a web developer.</p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">We learned that <i>headspace</i> has a maximum 2-week waiting period between scheduling and walking in for an appointment. Knowing this, we decided to create a fun and interactive way to engage young people while they wait for their first appointment at <i>headspace</i>.</p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">Once a young person has signed up for their first appointment at headspace, they will be able to use this app for 2 weeks to log information about how much they are eating, how much they are sleeping and how they are feeling overall.</p>

                                    <p class="descript-text">This information that is logged from the young person will then be transferred to a web application for counselors at headspace to access. This web application will show counselors a list of upcoming appointments, and provide charts to show how each young person has responded to the logging information.</p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">The experience of logging this information each day, and of counting down until the appointment date has been turned into a game where the user can create an image of their own personal waiting room. After logging their information each day, a menu of in-app items (pets, books, backgrounds, etc.) will be unlocked and the user will have the option to add one icon per day to their waiting room.</p>

                                    <br>

                                    <p class="descript-text">Each day, the app will count down the days until the scheduled appointment.</p>
